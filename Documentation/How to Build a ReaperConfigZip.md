#Ultraschall Guide: How to build a .ReaperConfigZip

## Step x: Changes in reaper-extstate.ini

[ultraschall_start]

firststart=true

startscreen=1

WARNING: hence the .ReaperConfigZip can only be produced from *within* REAPER, and the firststart setting will be set to *false* during every start, this has to be updated on the filesystem while REAPER is running !!12 (aka: Fledermausland)
