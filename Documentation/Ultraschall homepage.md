# Ultraschall -- Your companion through the badlands of podcasting software

## Design

A simple, minimalistic impression is aspired to. Distracting ornaments are unwelcome. Superfluous or redundant icons and menu entries are rigorously removed.

## Guided by workflow

Podcasters produce completely differently from musicians. We usually have the three phases of preparation, (live) show and post-production. Ultraschall's program composition is guided by these three phases and one can switch between the respective views back and forth at will.

## Podcast features

Functions that are useful for us podcasters are prominently placed: setting and naming chapter markers, their export to [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) and [Podlove](http://podlove.org/), routing presets for pre-show and (live) show, a Soundboard for audio shorts, as well as ripple edit that keeps tracks in sync, and so much more

## Multi-functional dock

From the dock, various tools can be selected and ordered: track mixer, `Master Mixer`, `Media Explorer`, `Navigator`, `Region/Marker Manager`, `Routing Matrix`, routing preset, `FX Browser` and `Big Clock`. The dock area can be divided in two or three parts. Tabs enable the management of tools in the dock areas.

## Soundboard

The function `Remove silence` enables the separation of audio inserts -- for example from the Soundboard -- so that only these inserts remain on the track. These can be marked with `Chapter marker foo`.

## Chapter markers

Chapter markers can be positioned to millisecond accuracy and organized into groups. Export options such as to clipboard, file and custom format enable the quick usage in [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) and [Podlove](http://podlove.org/).

## Variable playback

For more efficient post-production, the playback speed can be increased. Tone pitch remains constant of course.

## Cough buttons

OSC tools ([OSCulator](http://www.osculator.net/), [touchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc)) can be used as remotes during recording. Thus, chapter markers can be set live and muting automation is possible via cough buttons, e.g. on a Wiimote or iPad.

## Routing presets

The pre-defined routing presets can be activated with a single click; Just as on a digital mixing console. You can seamlessly switch between pre-show (only music to the livestream, but all podcasters can already hear each other and warm up), show (everything to the stream), post-show (low carpet of music) and cutting (nothing to the stream). You can also configure and save your own routing presets.

## Effects

The Ultraschall distribution makes essential effects easily accessible to podcasters: expander (composed of soft gate, compressor and limiter) and parametric EQ. These effects are non-destructive and can at any time be adjusted per track.

## VU meter

Large VU meters with peak display (numerical as well) enable the perfect amp drive. The target range of -18dB to -6dB is colored distinctly (yellow).

## Views

Ultraschall offers three preset window and tool arrangements for the workflow steps of preparation, show and post-production. These presets can be customized at will and more presets can easily be defined (including icons and short-cuts).

## Routing matrix for N-1 circuits

The routing matrix is a core concept of Ultraschall besides the workflow views. Only few can afford a digital mixing console for 1,000 $ or more, and that won't be necessary anymore anyway. Concepts like latency free listening, cable-free [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) or [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) circuits, as well as live jingles are easily possible with a combination of Ultraschall and a digital audio interface starting at 150 $. The various routing presets can be saved in templates so that a new show can begin in seconds.

## Color coding

Although Ultraschall strives for a minimalist, neutral impression, tracks can be colored by group or individually. Thus, a quick orientation over present speakers, [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) or [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) guests, jingles, etc. is ensured.

## Ripple editing

Ripple editing guarantees that even during complex cutting in post-production, tracks remain in sync with each other. Moreover, already set chapter markers remain correctly in place.
