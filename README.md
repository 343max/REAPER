# Ultraschall Podcasting Extensions for the Reaper DAW

[Podlove](http://podlove.org/) and [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) handed us podcast producers powerful tools, but an optimized environment for the actual recording and production of the podcasts was missing.

The various DAWs (digital audio workstations) have their own pros and cons in terms of costs and features. [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/) is hitting a widely recognized sweet spot here: for the slim [price of 60 USD](http://www.reaper.fm/purchase.php) one obtains the Swiss army officer's knife of DAWs, developed by audio nerds (the [old Winamp team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp#History)). One problem, though: [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)'s aesthetics -- rooted in the Windows world -- are a medium impertinence. Additionally, dozens of presets are well-tuned for music production, but out-of-the-box these are nearly **absurdly wrong** for us podcasters, such as the use of musical bars as time units.  

The Ultraschall distribution of presets, layouts and a theme tries to optimize [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/) as much as humanly possible for podcast production. This goal is approached from three levels:

- **Design.** A simple, minimalistic impression is aspired to. Distracting ornaments are unwelcome. Superfluous or redundant icons and menu entries are rigorously removed.
- **Guided by workflow.** Podcasters produce completely differently from musicians. We usually have the three phases of preparation, (live) show and post-production. Ultraschall's program composition is guided by these three phases and one can switch between the respective views back and forth at will.
- **Rapid access to podcast features.** Functions that are useful for us are prominently placed: setting and naming chapter markers, their export to [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) and [Podlove](http://podlove.org/), routing presets for pre-show and (live) show, a Soundboard for audio shorts, as well as ripple edit that keeps tracks in sync, and so much more

Use this distribution **on your own risk, because previous settings are generally overwritten without asking**. It is therefore advisable to back those up via `Preferences | General | Export Configurationâ€¦`. 

Our changes are designed to **probably** survive a [version bump by Reaper](http://reaperblog.net/category/reaper-updates/) without restrictions. Our changes affect a lot of different levels: file system (graphics), Walter theming file, project settings, Reaper settings, toolbar settings. All these changes are **open source** ([CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0)) and can be adjusted at will. However, one should have a clear concept what one tries to accomplish. A screencast episode that exclusively deals with modding is being planned.

All of the following details are based on the [English 64 bit version of Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/download.php) on a Mac with OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). Please find an [overview of the PC-compatible features here](http://ultraschall.fm/?page_id=462).
